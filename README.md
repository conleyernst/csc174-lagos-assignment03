Team Lagos Assignment 03: Updated Team Portfolio Website

Colophon:

IA: Conley 
  This website ties together three female students in CSC 174 who are computer science majors. 
  The three students selected are Lotus May, Conley Ernst, and Charolette Wright.Why Computer Science?"
  
  The IA created all of the origional files and created the skeleton structure of the page. Additionally, all bootstrap implemented and used was selected by the IA – ie. researching and implementing the card layouts, accordion layouts on the indivdual pages, and implementing the column layouts. Additionally are elements on page were positioned and placd by IA in the HTML.
  
  Ontology: The ontology of this website is surrounded by the concept of female CS majors in our class. 
  Taxonomy: Content from each user was broken up on the indivdual pages into main sections: General information (name/major/class year), Work Experience, Campus Involvement, and "Why Computer Science?". The goal of this was to present each person holistically and consistently page to page. All individuals are tied together on the home page and presented together under the women in CS section.
  Choreography: Having all three individuals under the Women in CS section shows them as components of the larger picture of women in CS. You can access each indivdual from their card or on the nav bar– both of which reflect the students from youngest to oldest: a sophomore, a junior, and a senior. Each page breaks up each indivdual's content in the same style.
